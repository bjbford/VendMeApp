# WELCOME TO TEAM VENDME!


## Project Scope:

Create an Android application that uses your deviceâ€™s location to return a map of dropped pins indicating all vending machines within an user adjustable radius of the device (within a reasonable tolerance). Upon, selecting a pin, it will display the actual location of the vending machine, its contents, prices, acceptable payment methods. It will also feature a search function that will return the nearest machines with the wanted product. The value for the consumer/user is an easier way to locate vending machines and by knowing what is in stock before venturing all the way to the machine. It creates value for vending companies by generating more revenue from an increase in exposure of their machines.

This will be achieved by interfacing with hardware already installed on most vending machines that is currently being used for vendors to keep track of inventory. For the scope of this project, we will simulate the vending machine hardware described above with our own hardware. If we do not have information about an existing vending machine, we will rely on crowdsourcing by allowing users to submit new machines and its current contents into our database, through the mobile application.
